HQ9+ (http://progopedia.com/language/hq9-plus/) Interpreter in Opa (http://opalang.org/) language.

This simple program uses several interesting Opa features:
- TRX parsing
- support for Twitter Bootstrap framework
- working with DOM
- shorthand syntax for XML

To compile just run "./compile" or directly "opa hq9plus.opa".

Compiler message "Unused variable accumulator." is because "accumulator" isn't really used by design in HQ9+
(but you can uncomment one line to print its value).

Opa version used for developing and testing:
Opa compiler (c) MLstate -- version S3.5 -- build 687
